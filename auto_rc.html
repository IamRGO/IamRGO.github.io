            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <!-- This is where you can write about your project. -->
            <p>
               In this project, the RC car is connected to a A.I. model and is operated by it to drive on its own.
               For the RC car to drive, the A.I. must be driven around a circuit and record the inputs and photos.
               Once the A.I. model has all the data, it can train itself and learn how to drive on the track.

            <h2>Capturing the User Input</h2>
            <p>
                In order to train the TensorFlow model, Arduino and Raspberry Pi were used to record the user input data while I was driving the RC around the test track.
                This data was used to train the Tensofrlow Model later on.

            </div>
            <p>RC Remote was modified to use Arduino to capture the user input, and Raspberry Pi on the RC to store the data.</p>

                While I was driving the RC car, the Raspberry Pi's webcam took a photo and saved the user's throttle and steering values.

            <h2>How the Tensorflow Sees the World</h2>
            <p>
                Since, the AI only needs to follow the track, it just needs to see the yellow rope on the floor. Everything else can be ignored.
                Here is how the TensorFlow sees the world:

            </div>

            <h2>Creating a TensorFlow Model</h2>
            <p>Tensorflow Model needed to be compact enough to run from the Raspberry Pi. Therefore, the image from web camera had to use a low resolution of 160x120 to produce 30 actions per second.</p>
            <p>Since the throttle value stayed constant around the track, the model only needed to generate a steering value. Because it produced just one output, the Raspberry Pi could run the model much faster.</p>
