            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <!-- This is where you can write about your project. -->
            <p>
               In this project, the RC car is connected to a A.I. model and is operated by it to drive on its own.
               For the RC car to drive, the A.I. must be driven around a circuit and record the inputs and photos.
               Once the A.I. model has all the data, it can train itself and learn how to drive on the track.

            <h2>Project Details</h2>
            <!-- Add more information about your project here. -->
            <p>
               I have taken an RC car, a camera, and a Raspberry Pi which had the AI model.
               I have also added an Arduino and a speed controller to control the speed of the RC car.
            </p>
            <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <!-- Discuss any challenges you faced and how you overcame them. -->
            <p>
               In this project, I have face certain issues while building the AI RC car.
            </p>
            <p>
               One of these issues was the data that the AI was trained with. Because the AI was observing everything in the photo, it was not focusing on the track layout.
               To solve this, I made a python script that will go through all the recorded photos and edit out everything except the track.
