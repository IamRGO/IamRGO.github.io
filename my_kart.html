            <h2>Project Description</h2>
            <!-- This is where you can write about your project. -->
            <p>
                The main goal for this project was to build a Go-kart over in the summer.
                As a result, the design of the Go-kart is made to be as simple as possible,
                with the only complication involved in the powertrain and steering system.
            </p>
            <h2>Project Details</h2>
            <!-- Add more information about your project here. -->
            <p>
                This Go-kart is design with a Ackermann steering system, providing different turning angles for the front wheels.
                What this does is that it gives the driver greater handling compared to a bogie kart.
            </p>

            <h2>Challenges and Solutions</h2>
            <!-- Discuss any challenges you faced and how you overcame them. -->
            <p>
                One of the issues that came up during this project was the reliability of the steering system.
                For instance, as you turn the Go-kart, the front wheels will begin to bend and break due to the lateral forces applied onto them.
                To solve this, the front of the Go-kart needed more stability to support the wheels. Thus, a long metal piece was added in order to
                keep the wheels in place. The solution resulted in a much more reliable Go-kart, providing more time to drive the Go-kart.
